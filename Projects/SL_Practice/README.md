# Fare Prediction for Uber

Train-Test Data Set : https://github.com/Simplilearn-Edu/Machine-Learning--Projects/tree/master/Projects/Course%20End%20Projects/Project%209.1%20-%20Uber%20Fare%20Prediction/Dataset%20for%20the%20project

DESCRIPTION

# Project Objective: 
Design an algorithm which will tell the fare to be charged for a passenger.

# Problem Statement Scenario: 
A fare calculator helps a customer in identifying the fare valid for the trip. They are often used by passengers who are new to a city or tourists to get an estimate of travel costs. You are provided with a dataset with features like fare amount, pickup and drop location, passenger count, and so on.

# Following actions should be performed:
* Understand the type of data.
* Identify the output variable.
* Identify the factors which affect the output variable.
* Check if there are any biases in your dataset.
* Count the null values existing in columns.
* Remove the null value rows in the target variable.
* Perform train test split.
* Predict the accuracy using regression models.
* Check and compare the accuracy of the different models.
